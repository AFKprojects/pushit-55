# ButtonApp - Mobile Documentation

*[This appears to be extracted from the uploaded zip file. Let me create a proper structure to analyze the mobile documentation.]*

Based on the binary content in the zip file, this appears to contain documentation for a mobile version of the ButtonApp project. To properly analyze the consistency with the current project, I need to extract and review the specific documents.

## Key Areas to Review:

1. **Database Schema Compatibility**
2. **API Endpoints Alignment** 
3. **Authentication Flow Consistency**
4. **Real-time Features Mapping**
5. **Business Logic Rules Alignment**

## Initial Observations:

The zip file appears to contain:
- ButtonApp documentation (main app specs)
- AppViews CSV (view definitions)
- Odznaki CSV (badges system)
- Tasks CSV (task management)

These components need to be mapped against the current project structure to identify inconsistencies.
